### what does it looks like?

![image](https://github.com/pickingname/bsodclock/assets/115550149/e6b588c2-43b3-4e67-96f7-fb460a59eb6f)

the percent progress is actually synced with time of the day, 0% = 0:00 | 50% = 12:00 | 100% = 23:59

### the future

- i will try to make the weather change based on users location using geolocation api
- i will not provide the openweathermap api key
